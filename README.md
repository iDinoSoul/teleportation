# teleportation
This Minecraft datapack allows non-opped players to teleport to one another using /trigger commands!

How to Install:
1. Download the datapack (Clone or download -> Download ZIP)
2. Open the Minecraft world folder, then the "datapacks" folder (Main menu -> Singleplayer -> Select a world, then edit -> Open World Folder -> datapacks).
3. In the folder you just downloaded is another folder called "teleportation-master," and inside that is "teleportation." Drag that folder into the "datapacks" folder in your world folder.
4. If you are already logged into your world, type /reload. If this does not show a welcome message, type /datapack enable "file/teleportation" first, then do /reload.
5. Done!
