Hey! Thanks for checking out this datapack!

Just a few words before you're all good to go: make sure that you have (or
anyone else who should have administrative rights has) the "Admin" tag before
you use the datapack. Both the successful installation message and the
successful will only display to those that have this tag, though the rest of
the datapack will function just fine for those without this tag.

Use the below commands to give yourself/anyone this tag:

/tag @s add Admin
/tag <Player_Name> add Admin
